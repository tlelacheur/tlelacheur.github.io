      <description>Probability Review The probability of an event in which all outcomes are equally likely is given by: $$Pr(\text{X}) = \dfrac{\text{Number of positive outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}}$$
For all events $0 &amp;lt;= Pr(X) &amp;lt;= 1$ A sample space is a set of all the possible outcomes The complement of an event $X$ is the probability that it does not occur: $Pr(\text{not }X)=1-Pr(X)$ Examples Example 1: A letter is randomly chosen from the word AEROPLANE.</description>

Also, 8Â people like both comedies and action movies and 3 like neither comedies nor action movies. a) Construct a Venn diagram for the survey results ||{&amp;#34;id&amp;#34;:1202011389160}|| b) How many people: i) like comedies ii) do not like action movies iii) like only comedies? ||{&amp;#34;id&amp;#34;:1116124509556}|| c) If one of the 25 people is randomly selected, find: i) Pr(likes comedy and action) ii) Pr (likes neither comedy nor action) iii) Pr(like action only) ||{&amp;#34;id&amp;#34;:1241208540428}|| Example 2: Thirty people at a gym are asked about their gym usage.</description>
